Business Reccomendations for CourseKata;

Increase Engagement
-Engagement and care vary across chapter, tend to decrease in later ones. 
-Number of questions on a page correlates with engagement, mostly plaintext and mcq lrn_type. 
-Plaintext and mcq positively correlates to engage to idle ratio (how long engaged per idle_brief), so more questions also means less likelihood of distractions. 
-However, the engaged index (what proportion of engaged time is total time on page), count of question actually negatively correlates, so although more questions makes student stay engaged longer, but more questions also increase the overall time they are not engaged, possible that too much overwhelms students. 
Recommendation for chapters less engaged:can use more plaintext and mcq to boost engagement. 
-However, for longer term, should try explore more different question types, find the best type that can increase engagement, idle ratio and engagement index, as some question types lack enough data. 

Response to construct
-Higher response to construct (excluding cost), tend to result in higher EOC, engage to idle ratio and tried again clicks. Demonstrating better effort, focus and learning. 
-EOC tend to decrease with chapter, so is attempt ratio, meaning student also cares less in later chapters
-So want to increase response score to construct overall, but especially in later chapters
-Expectancy constructs occurs most in low response score
Recommendation on increase score of expectancy, getting better in retained learning:
-Tried_again_clicks correlate with high score on expectancy, encourage trying again
-Score 1 in expectancy watches least video, encourage watching more video
-Chapter 2 has the most in high score, should investigate further in why and can model other chapter after it
-Chapter 3,4,7,8,9 less high expectancy score, should investigate further in why
-Utlity scores the most in 5 to 6, student value utility, tailor content more to utility value
